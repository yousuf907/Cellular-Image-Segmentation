***Image Segmentation of Zona-Ablated Human Blastocysts:

Automating   human   preimplantation   embryo   grading offers the potential for higher success rates with in vitro fertilization (IVF) by providing new quantitative and objective measures of embryo quality. Current IVF procedures typically use  only  qualitative  manual  grading,  which  is  limited  in  the  identification of genetically abnormal embryos. The automatic quantitative assessment of blastocyst expansion can potentially improve  sustained  pregnancy  rates  and  reduce  health  risks  from    abnormal    pregnancies    through    a    more    accurate    identification  of  genetic  abnormality.  The  expansion  rate  of  a  blastocyst  is  an  important  morphological  feature  to  determine  the quality of a developing embryo. In this work, a deep learning based    human    blastocyst    image    segmentation    method    is    presented,  with  the  goal  of  facilitating  the  challenging  task  of  segmenting   irregularly   shaped   blastocysts.   The   type   of   blastocysts  evaluated  here  has  undergone  laser  ablation  of  the  zona   pellucida,   which   is   required   prior   to   trophectoderm   biopsy.  This  complicates  the  manual  measurements  of  the  expanded  blastocyst’s  size,  which  shows  a  correlation  with  genetic  abnormalities.  The  experimental  results  on  the  test  set  demonstrate  segmentation  greatly  improves  the  accuracy  of  expansion  measurements,  resulting  in  up  to  99.4%  accuracy,  98.1% precision, 98.8% recall, a 98.4% Dice Coefficient, and a 96.9% Jaccard Index.

***Inner Cell Mass and Trophectoderm Segmentation in Human Blastocyst Images:

Embryo     quality     assessment     based     on     morphological  attributes  is  important  for  achieving  higher  pregnancy rates from in vitro fertilization (IVF). The accurate segmentation  of  the  embryo’s  inner  cell  mass  (ICM)  and  trophectoderm   epithelium   (TE)   is   important,   as   these   parameters  can  help  to  predict  the  embryo  viability  and  live  birth potential. However, segmentation of the ICM and TE is difficult  due  to  variations  in  their  shape  and  similarities  in  their   textures,   both   with   each   other   and   with   their   surroundings. To tackle this problem, a deep neural network (DNN)  based  segmentation  approach  was  implemented.  The  DNN can identify the ICM region with 99.1% accuracy, 94.9% precision, 93.8% recall, a 94.3% Dice Coefficient, and a 89.3% Jaccard  Index.  It  can  extract  the  TE  region  with  98.3%  accuracy,   91.8%   precision,   93.2%   recall,   a   92.5%   Dice   Coefficient, and a 85.3% Jaccard Index.
